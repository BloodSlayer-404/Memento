### Introduction:
This is an example of the behavioral design pattern called "Memento" for an app that helps you learn about design patterns, you can find that app [here](https://github.com/JoseMartinez117/AppPatrones "here").

#### About: 
The example is based on the Save States system present in the emulators for retro videogames console, more specifically, when you create a Save State in a Pokemon game. 

This Save State takes all the data of your game in that moment, and saves it, allowing you to load that Save State if you commit an error or need to repeat an action that affected negatively your playthrough. 

#### Documentation: 
The documentation of the methods and classes created for the example is in the [Javadoc](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Memento/tree/master/JavaDoc "Javadoc") folder. 

You can check the coverage of the unitary test created for this proyect in the [htmlReport](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Memento/tree/master/htmlReport "htmlReport") folder, you can create more test for your own methods.
